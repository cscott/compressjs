# compressjs

`compressjs` contains fast pure-JavaScript implementations of various
de/compression algorithms, including `bzip2`, Charles Bloom's
[LZP3](http://www.cbloom.com/papers/lzp.pdf),
a modified
[LZJB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZJB),
`PPM-D`, and an implementation of
[Dynamic Markov Compression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Markov_Compression).
`compressjs` is written by C. Scott Ananian.
The Range Coder used is a JavaScript port of
[Michael Schindler's C range coder](http://www.compressconsult.com/rangecoder).
Bits also also borrowed from Yuta Mori's
[SAIS implementation](https://sites.google.com/site/yuta256/sais);
[Eli Skeggs](https://github.com/skeggse/node-bzip),
[Kevin Kwok](https://github.com/antimatter15/bzip2.js),
[Rob Landley](http://www.landley.net/code/bunzip-4.1.c),
[James Taylor](https://bitbucket.org/james_taylor/seek-bzip2/),
and [Matthew Francis](https://code.google.com/p/jbzip2)
for Bzip2 compression and decompression code.
"Bear" wrote the [original JavaScript LZJB](https://code.google.com/p/jslzjb/);
the version here is based on the
[node lzjb module](https://github.com/cscott/lzjb).

## Compression benchmarks
Here are some representative speeds and sizes for the various algorithms
implemented in this package.  Times are with node 0.8.22 on my laptop, but
they should be valid for inter-algorithm comparisons.

### Algorithm descriptions
* `compressjs.Bzip2` (`-t bzip2`) is the bzip2 algorithm we all have
  come to know and love.  It has a block size between 100k and 900k.
* `compressjs.BWTC` (`-t bwtc`) is substantially the same, but with a
  few simplifications/improvements which make it faster, smaller, and
  not binary-compatible.  In particular, the unnecessary initial RLE step
  of bzip2 is omitted, and we use a range coder with an adaptive
  context-0 model after the MTF/RLE2 step, instead of the static
  huffman codes of bzip2.
* `compressjs.PPM` (`-t ppm`) is a naive/simple implementation of the
  [PPMD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_by_partial_matching)
  algorithm with a 256k sliding window.
* `compressjs.Lzp3` (`-t lzp3`) is an algorithm similar to Charles
  Bloom's [LZP3](http://www.cbloom.com/papers/lzp.pdf) algorithm.
  It uses a 1M sliding window, a context-4 model, and a range coder.
* `compressjs.Dmc` (`-t dmc`) is a partial implementation of [Dynamic
  Markov Compression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Markov_compression).
  Unlike most DMC implementations, our implementation is bytewise (not
  bitwise).  There is currently no provision for shrinking the Markov
  model (or throwing it out when it grows too large), so be careful
  with large inputs!  I may return to twiddle with this some more; see
  the source for details.
* `compressjs.Lzjb` (`-t lzjb`) is a straight copy of the fast
  [LZJB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZJB) algorithm from
  <https://github.com/cscott/lzjb>.
* `compressjs.LzjbR` (`-t lzjbr`) is a hacked version of LZJB which
  uses a range coder and a bit of modeling instead of the fixed
  9-bit literal / 17-bit match format of the original.

The remaining algorithms are self-tests for various bits of
compression code, not real compressors. `Context1Model` is a simple
adaptive context-1 model using a range coder.  `Huffman` is an
adaptive Huffman coder using
[Vitter's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Huffman_coding#Vitter_algorithm).
`MTFModel`, `FenwickModel`, and `DefSumModel` are simple adaptive
context-0 models with escapes, implementing using a move-to-front
list, a [Fenwick tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree), and
Charles Bloom's
[deferred summation algorithm](http://cbloom.com/papers/context.pdf),
respectively.  `Simple` is a static context-0 model for the range
coder.  `NoModel` encodes the input bits directly; it shows the
basic I/O overhead, as well as the few bytes of overhead due to the
[file magic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29#Magic_numbers_in_files)
and a variable-length encoding of the uncompressed size of the file.

## How to install

```
npm install compressjs
```
or
```
volo add cscott/compressjs
```

This package uses
[Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Typed_arrays)
if available, which are present in node.js >= 0.5.5 and many modern
browsers.  Full browser compatibility table
is available at [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/typedarrays); briefly:
IE 10, Firefox 4, Chrome 7, or Safari 5.1.

## Testing

```
npm install
npm test
```

## Usage

There is a binary available in bin:
```
$ bin/compressjs --help
$ echo "Test me" | bin/compressjs -t lzp3 -z > test.lzp3
$ bin/compressjs -t lzp3 -d test.lzp3
Test me
```

The `-t` argument can take a number of different strings to specify
the various compression algorithms available.  Use `--help` to see
the various options.

From JavaScript:
```
var compressjs = require('compressjs');
var algorithm = compressjs.Lzp3;
var data = new Buffer('Example data', 'utf8');
var compressed = algorithm.compressFile(data);
var uncompressed = algorithm.uncompressFile(compressed);
// convert from array back to string
var data2 = new Buffer(uncompressed).toString('utf8');
console.log(data2);
```
There is a streaming interface as well.  Use `Uint8Array` or normal
JavaScript arrays when running in a browser.

See the tests in the `tests/` directory for further usage examples.

## Documentation

`require('compressjs')` returns a `compressjs` object.  Its fields
correspond to the various algorithms implemented, which export one of
two different interfaces, depending on whether it is a "compression
method" or a "model/coder".

### Compression Methods
Compression methods (like `compressjs.Lzp3`) export two methods.
The first is a function accepting one, two or three parameters:

`cmp.compressFile = function(input, [output], [Number compressionLevel] or [props])`

The `input` argument can be a "stream" object (which must implement the
`readByte` method), or a `Uint8Array`, `Buffer`, or array.

If you omit the second argument, `compressFile` will return a JavaScript
array containing the byte values of the compressed data.  If you pass
a second argument, it must be a "stream" object (which must implement the
`writeByte` method).

The third argument may be omitted, or a number between 1 and 9 indicating
a compression level (1 being largest/fastest compression and 9 being
smallest/slowest compression).  Some algorithms also permit passing
an object for finer-grained control of various compression properties.

The second exported method is a function accepting one or two parameters:

`cmp.decompressFile = function(input, [output])`

The `input` parameter is as above.

If you omit the second argument, `decompressFile` will return a
`Uint8Array`, `Buffer` or JavaScript array with the decompressed
data, depending on what your platform supports.  For most modern
platforms (modern browsers, recent node.js releases) the returned
value will be a `Uint8Array`.

If you provide the second argument, it must be a "stream", implementing
the `writeByte` method.

### Models and coders

The second type of object implemented is a model/coder.  `Huffman` and
`RangeCoder` share the same interface as the simple context-0 probability
models `MTFModel`, `FenwickModel`, `LogDistanceModel`, and
`DeflateDistanceModel`.

`model.factory = function(parameters)`

This method returns a function which can be invoked with a `size` argument to
create a new instance of this model with the given parameters (which usually
include the input/output stream or coder).

`model.encode = function(symbol, [optional context])`

This method encodes the given symbol, possibly with the given additional
context, and then updates the model or adaptive coder if necessary.
The symbol is usually in the range `[0, size)`, although some
models allow adding "extra symbols" to the possible range, which are
usually given negative values.  For example, you might want to create a
`LogDistanceModel` with one extra state to encode "same distance as the
last one encoded".

`model.decode = function([optional context])`

Decode the next symbol and updates the model or adaptive coder.
The values returned are usually in the range `[0, size]` although
negative numbers may be returned if you requested "extra symbols" when
you created the model.
